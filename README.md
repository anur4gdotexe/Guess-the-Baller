# Guess-the-Baller
Guess-the-Baller is a web-based guess game which tests for playerâ€™s footballing knowledge developed using Java Servlets and Java ServerPages. The objective of this game is to guess the correct football player on the basis of their characteristic fields which include their club, league, country, position, and age. The game is highly inspired by <b>wordle.</b> <br><br>

## Technologies Used
The project makes use of front-end development languages <b>HTML</b> (Hyper Text Markup Language), <b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets), <b>JavaScript</b> for designing the webpages and back-end requirements were fulfilled with <b>Java Servlets</b>, <b>JSP</b> (Java Server Pages), <b>JDBC</b> (Java Database Connector) and <b>MySQL</b> for database necessities. <br><br>

## The MVC Architecture
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller. Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other.

## Project Plan & Design Strategy
The main design procedure in this project work has been carried out with the simulations being done in Eclipse IDE which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing applications using the Java programming language and other programming languages such as C/C++, Python, PERL, Ruby etc. 

Back-end development with Java involves extensive use of servlets, JSP as well as JDBC.<br><br>
